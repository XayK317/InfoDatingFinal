          Love after Covid<br />
        </h1>

        <!-- Paragraph -->
        <p class="text-lg font-medium leading-relaxed">
          The Coronavirus, which dominated the early 2020s, was a generationally
      defining event. The virus and subsequent lockdowns accelerated a growing
      trend of loneliness across all demographics. The effectively "lost time"
      created a deficit in both social interaction and romantic connections.
      This presented a valuable opportunity for dating apps and services to help
      compensate for these dulled social skills, leading to a spike in users.
<br> <br/>
      What inspired this project was this table we found which predicted that the number
      of people using dating apps would increase in the years following the pandemic.
      In our investigation we instead found the widespread influence and usage of dating apps instead.
          <br/> 
          In our findings, around 30% of people have tried dating apps with a surprisingly even distribution 
          among races. Unsurprisingly the age brackets from 18-24 amd 30-49 dominate most of the users. 
          A surprising development however was the prevalence in LGB idetifying people using dating apps, 
          being nearly double the amount of straight identifying people. 
          <br/> <br/>
          In our research as well we found that not all dating apps are used evenly.
          Of the six we have found data on, Tinder reigns supreme with it being 
          the app of choice for most of the country. Including 46 percent of people
          who have tried dating apps have used Tinder before. The next closest app 
          is match.com with 31% of people who have tried it, with Bumble tailing
          closely behinfd with 28%. However, despite it being the third most popular,
         it only has two states where it is the most popluar, putting it on par with
         the vastly smaller app, plenty of fish. We only managed to scratch the surface
         of the data available, but we think we have found enough to make a interesting 
         basis.

         <br/> <br/>
          Another finding we stumbled on was how users would rate there experience on these apps.
          The split was close to half and half, with some LGB users having 61% having positive
          experiences, with men being the second highest with 57%. However the highest 
          negative amount of experiences came from women, who with 13% of them having a very 
          negative experience. On the sexual orientation side, 12% of straight people would rate
          their experience as very negative, which is fairly expected. However, LGB users only had
          5% who would rate their experience as very negative. 
          <br/> <br/>
          The reason we chose the way we did to show off the data was mostly due to the already
          substantial and well put together data out there already. With how many moving
          parts there are to the data and so many variables, it would be difficult to match
          the existing resources already provided. So instead we focused on how to show off
          a handful of these resources in a convient way instead. However, since we where
          using a few different styles of graphs, it made a united design difficult, so we 
          had to sacrifice function over design at points.
          <br/> <br/>
